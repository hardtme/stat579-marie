# stat579-marie
My GitHub repo for STAT 579

- My GitHub username is hardtme

- 3 main activities for the past month:

  * Schoolwork
  
  * Playing clarinet
  
  * Walking around my neighborhood
  
- I've mostly worked with medical data for survival analysis. I've also worked with sales and weather data during an internship that I had.

- 3 most important tools/strategies I use for analyzing data:
  
  - Make sure the data is read into R how you would expect
  
  - Determine where NAs tend to occur and how many there are
  
  - After the data is in the form you want, save a copy so you can easily use it later
